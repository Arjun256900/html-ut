        The University of Toronto (UToronto or U of T) is a public research
        university in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located on the grounds that
        surround Queen's Park. It was founded by royal charter in 1827 as King's
        College, the first institution of higher learning in Upper Canada.
        Originally controlled by the Church of England, the university assumed
        its present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution. As a
        collegiate university, it comprises 11 colleges each with substantial
        autonomy on financial and institutional affairs and significant
        differences in character and history. The university maintains three
        campuses, the oldest of which is St. George, located in downtown
        Toronto. The other two satellite campuses are located in Scarborough and
        Mississauga. The University of Toronto offers over 700 undergraduate and
        200 graduate programs. The university receives the most annual
        scientific research funding and endowment of any Canadian university and
        is one of two members of the Association of American Universities
        outside the United States, alongside McGill University.[7] Academically,
        the University of Toronto is noted for influential movements and
        curricula in literary criticism and communication theory, known
        collectively as the Toronto School. It is the largest university in
        Canada in terms of enrolment with more than 97,000 students.[8]
