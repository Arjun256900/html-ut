    <h1>About U of T</h1>
    <p>
      The University of Toronto (UToronto or U of T) is a public research
      university in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located on the grounds that
      surround Queen's Park. It was founded by royal charter in 1827 as King's
      College, the first institution of higher learning in Upper Canada.
      Originally controlled by the Church of England, the university assumed its
      present name in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution. As a collegiate
      university, it comprises 11 colleges each with substantial autonomy on
      financial and institutional affairs and significant differences in
      character and history. The university maintains three campuses, the oldest
      of which is St. George, located in downtown Toronto. The other two
      satellite campuses are located in Scarborough and Mississauga. The
      University of Toronto offers over 700 undergraduate and 200 graduate
      programs. The university receives the most annual scientific research
      funding and endowment of any Canadian university and is one of two members
      of the Association of American Universities outside the United States,
      alongside McGill University.[7] Academically, the University of Toronto is
      noted for influential movements and curricula in literary criticism and
      communication theory, known collectively as the Toronto School. It is the
      largest university in Canada in terms of enrolment with more than 97,000
      students.[8]
